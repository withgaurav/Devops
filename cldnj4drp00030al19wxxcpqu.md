# Getting Started with GitHub for Beginners

Welcome to the world of Github! If you're new to Github, don't worry, this guide will help you get started.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that helps you store, manage, and share your code with others. It's a great place for developers to collaborate on projects and track changes to their code.

### Getting started

* Sign up for a Github account - it's free!
    
* Create a new repository by clicking the "+" button in the top right corner.
    
* Give your repository a name, add a description, and select if you want it to be public or private.
    
* Start adding your code to the repository.
    
* Congratulations, you now have a repository on Github!
    

### Basic terminology

* **Repository**: A place to store your code and related files.
    
* **Commit**: A change or update you make to your code.
    
* **Branch**: A version of your code that you can work on without affecting the main version.
    
* **Pull request:** A request for changes to be added to the main version of your code.
    

Collaborating with Github makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same project. You can add collaborators to your repository and they can make changes, too. When you're ready to merge the changes, you can create a pull request to have them added to the main version of your code.

That's it! You now know the basics of Github. Start exploring the platform and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Happy coding! ðŸ’»
